Therapeutic Visualization Projects
________________________

####new home of an ancient project previously known as:
- Recursion Projection Therapy
- Intelligent Healing Spaces
- Interactive Healing Spaces
- TherapyViz
- Enhanced Visualization Therapy

####Tools for the Kit (outdated and interesting):
- Enhanced Visualization (EV) Therapy :: Technology :: 3 Parts :: 
	1] EV_Projections :: Enhanced Visualization Projections :: computer1 :: imagery projected directly onto client in physical space :: 
    2] Acu_AR :: Augmented Reality Acupressure :: computer2 :: visable as Augmented Reality in video goggles or on face-cradle display :: 
    3] IHS :: Intelligent Healing Space  :: responsive environment with sensors, feedback mechanisms, and awareness of client and session
 
- Naming Convention::
	-EV_Projections = drop "Projections" [eg EV_Projection_Foo --> EV_Foo] 
		- // updated from previous convention, which also added prefixes [eg Acu(EV_Projection)_Foo --> Acu(EV)_Foo (eg Acu(EV)_Point)]
    -Acu_AR = add underscore + suffix as necessary, such that FlowFieldFoo --> Acu_AR_FlowFieldFoo
        - // updated previous convention, which was :: 
        - base case = "EV_AR" :: drop "EV" [eg EV_AR_Foo --> AR_Foo] && Add prefixes [eg Acu(EV_AR)_Foo --> Acu(AR)_Foo (eg Acu(AR)_Point)]
    -IHS = add underscore + suffix as necessary, such that Strong A.I. = IHS_Awareness ;)
 
- EV_Projections::Computer1::Tronik::MacBookPro_Lion10.7::8gigsRam::Procesing1.5.1
    -uses the InFocus ShortThrow projector positioned over the massage table
    -uses Kinect positioned near the projector directly above massage table
    -includes:  
    	- **EV_PointGenerator** :: created and controlled via gesture and touchOSC (via iPad suspended in space and iPhone attached to my arm)
       	- **EV_Point** ::Acupressure Point via Projections
       	- **EV_Vehicle** :: "life-like and improvisational" particles with goals, desires, abilities, behaviors and awareness of self, others, and EV session details
       	- **EV_FlowFieldDepth** :: Vector Field :: Direction from depth contours, Force from slope angle + gravity - friction
       	- **EV_FlowFieldIllumination** :: Vector Field :: Direction from projected light's location :: Force Magnitude from Brightness of projected light as seen by Kinect1 RGB.
       	- **EV_FeedbackLoop**
 
 
 Acu_AR::Computer2::Megatronik::MacPro_8core_3GHz::6gigsRam[sigh]::Processing1.5.1 [after 8 weeks of openFrameworks]
     -1st DVI out to 24inch main screen
     -2nd DVI out downshifted to VGA and sent to VGA 1x4 splitter
     -1x4 VGA Splitters out to:
           1. Face-Cradle Display :: 19inch Dell (1024x768) attached to massage table via manfrotto clamp with articulating joint
           2. Vuzix 920 Video Goggles for client in supine position
           3. Vuzix 920 Video Goggles for therapist
           (Vuzix each also require USB-2 to Computer2 for Power (and Perhaps signal information as well (perhaps USB powered hub would work?))
           4. Video Projector:: rear projected at fabric above space
           making session viewable to public outside space while retaining coherence with healing space with curtains closed
     -includes:
       Acu_AR_PointGenerator
       Acu_AR_Point
       Acu_AR_Object
       Acu_AR_Vehicle
       Acu_AR_FlowFieldDepth
       Acu_AR_FlowFieldIllumination
       Acu_AR_FeedbackLoop
       */
